# =====================================================
# Step 1: Load the event log and discover the Petri net
# =====================================================

# Read the event log from an XES file.
log = pm4py.read_xes("../tests/input_data/running-example.xes")

# Discover a Petri net using the inductive miner. Note that discovering the net on the entire log
# might lead to underfitting. In some cases, focusing on a subset of variants can yield a more precise model.
net, initial_marking, final_marking = pm4py.discover_petri_net_inductive(log)

# =====================================================
# Step 2: Create and customize the stochastic map
# =====================================================

# Generate the stochastic map from the log and the discovered Petri net.
# The map assigns a duration model (random variable) to each transition.
stochastic_map = replay.get_map_from_log_and_net(log, net, initial_marking, final_marking)
print("Original stochastic map (derived from log):")
print(stochastic_map)

# To customize activity durations, you can manually override the random variables
# for each transition. Here are three examples of random variable distributions:

for trans in list(stochastic_map.keys()):
    # --- Normal Distribution ---
    # Parameters:
    #   mu (mean): expected duration value (here set to 5 time units)
    #   sigma (standard deviation): variability around the mean (set to 3 time units)
    rv_normal = random_variables.normal.random_variable.Normal(mu=5, sigma=3)
    print(f"Normal distribution for transition '{trans}': {rv_normal}")

    # --- Exponential Distribution ---
    # Parameters:
    #   loc: a shift parameter (minimum duration, here set to 1)
    #   scale: the mean waiting time between events (set to 1)
    rv_exponential = random_variables.exponential.random_variable.Exponential(loc=1, scale=1)
    print(f"Exponential distribution for transition '{trans}': {rv_exponential}")

    # --- Uniform Distribution ---
    # Parameters:
    #   loc: lower bound of the duration (here set to 0)
    #   scale: range of the duration (so durations are equally likely between 0 and 1)
    rv_uniform = random_variables.uniform.random_variable.Uniform(loc=0, scale=1)
    print(f"Uniform distribution for transition '{trans}': {rv_uniform}")

    # For this example, we choose to override with the normal distribution.
    stochastic_map[trans] = rv_normal

print("Customized stochastic map (after manual override):")
print(stochastic_map)

# =====================================================
# Step 3: Configure simulation parameters and run simulation
# =====================================================

# Set up simulation parameters:
sim_parameters = {
    # Use the customized stochastic map for transition durations.
    "provided_stochastic_map": stochastic_map,
    # Number of simulation runs to perform.
    "num_simulations": 2,
    # Case arrival ratio in seconds.
    # (For example, 86400 seconds corresponds to a new case starting every day.)
    "case_arrival_ratio": 86400
}

# Run the Monte Carlo simulation using the Petri net, the log, and the parameters.
simulated_log, simulation_results = monte_carlo_simulator.apply(log, net, initial_marking, final_marking,
                                                                parameters=sim_parameters)

# Convert the simulated log into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
simulated_log_df = pm4py.convert_to_dataframe(simulated_log)
print("Simulated timestamps before start time adjustment:")
print(simulated_log_df["time:timestamp"])

# =====================================================
# Step 4: Adjust simulated timestamps to add a start time
# =====================================================

# To align the simulation results with a specific real-world start time,
# we can apply an offset to all timestamps.
# For example, to set the start time to January 1, 2024:
desired_start_time = pd.Timestamp("2024-01-01")
unix_epoch = pd.Timestamp("1970-01-01")
# Calculate the offset between the desired start time and the Unix epoch.
offset = desired_start_time - unix_epoch

# Adjust each timestamp in the simulated log by adding the offset.
simulated_log_df["time:timestamp"] = simulated_log_df["time:timestamp"] + offset
print("Simulated timestamps after start time adjustment:")
print(simulated_log_df["time:timestamp"])

# =====================================================
# End of Script
# =====================================================

# The above script:
# - Discovers a process model from an event log.
# - Creates a stochastic map for transition durations.
# - Demonstrates how to manually override durations using various distributions.
# - Configures and runs the Monte Carlo simulation.
# - Adjusts the simulation's timestamps to align with a desired start time.
